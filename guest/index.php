                    <p>
                        First of all, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone of you, by being part of the network you are helping to
                        support its' development and I am forever grateful for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The network is only a few months old right now so I do apologise that we don't have many statistics available for you, 
                        but truthfully what matters the most is that there are so many people out there willing to support us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The progress we've made in 2024 has been immense, right from my first prototype of AuthCat all the way to NoteCat, 
                        the newest application on the network, all in only a few short months! With all of 2025 ahead of us I know this year
                        is going to bring big things, and I look forward to seeing what they are!
                    </p>
                    <?php
                    if (isset($__WESTWAY__)) echo "<p>And to all of you at Westway, I just wanted to thank you for everything you have done for me! It's hard to say where I would be today if I hadn't started working with all of you lovely people.</p>";
                    ?>
                    <p>
                        Wishing you an incredible year.
                    </p>
